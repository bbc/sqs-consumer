# BBC Contributor Licence Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing. The BBC welcomes contributions from contract partners, 
hardware manufacturers, and any interested parties.

In order to accept contributions, we need all contributors grant Us a licence to the intellectual
property rights in their Contributions. This Agreement (“Agreement”) is intended to protect your 
rights as a contributor, and to help ensure that the intellectual property contained
within is available to the whole community, to use and build on.

The Agreement does not change Your rights to use Your Contributions for any other purpose.

1. Definitions:

“Contribution” means any past, present and future contributions of object code, source code and
documentation submitted to the BBC (including electronically, verbally, written, by electronic
mailing lists, source code control systems and issue tracking systems managed by or on behalf of
the BBC), but excludes any communication marked “Not a Contribution”.

“You” or “Your” means the individual copyright owner, or company or organisation if You are
entering into the BBC Contributor Agreement as an authorised representative of Your company or
