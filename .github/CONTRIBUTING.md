## Reporting Issues

Before opening a new issue, first check that there is not already an [open issue or Pull Request](https://github.com/bbc/sqs-consumer/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen) that addresses it.

If there is, make relevant comments and add your reaction. Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

- 👍 - upvote
- 👎 - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

1. Pick an appropriate template for the type of issue [from here](https://github.com/bbc/sqs-consumer/issues/choose)
2. Provide as much detail as possible
3. Follow your issue in the issue tracking workflow

Follow the setup instructions in the [README](../README.md).

Ensure all your code is thoroughly tested and that this testing is detailed in the pull request.
